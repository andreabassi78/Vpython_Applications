# Vpython_Applications
Vpython code to simulate Newtonian mechanics problems. 

It includes scripts to simulate basic kinematics problems ([accelerated motion], [circular motion]), dynamics([oscillators], [gravitation]) and more advanced physics problems ([N bodies problem], [Brownian motion]).

## Requirements
You can run the scripts (.py) from the IDE/console after installing [vpython]:

    pip install vpython
